# next-graphql-api

This is a dummy project that belongs to this (link will follow) blog. It's an example for using Firestore and Apollo/GraphQL to manage a movie collection.
You have to create a service account and Firestore collection your self if you want to fork and play around with it.

## How to run this project


From the api directory spin up the GraphQL server on `localhost:4000`
```
npm start
```

From the frontend directory spin up the NextJS app on `localhost:3000`
